# Building OsaurusCore

The xcode workspace has pre-existing build failures in external dependencies (`mlx-swift-lm`, `IkigaJSON`). Never use `xcodebuild` to verify changes — it will always fail on those deps and waste tokens.

Instead, compile only the OsaurusCore package sources (no linking) to verify your changes:

```bash
cd /Users/tpae/dev/osaurus/Packages/OsaurusCore && swift build 2>&1 | grep -E "error:" | grep -v "ChatWindowState\|ModelRuntime\|MLX\|IkigaJSON"
```

Known pre-existing errors to ignore (not caused by your changes):
- `ChatWindowState.swift` — `NSObject?` to `NSImage?` cast
- `ModelRuntime.swift` — `MLX.Memory` missing member

If the filtered output is empty, your code compiles cleanly.
