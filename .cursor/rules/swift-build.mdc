# Building OsaurusCore

The xcode workspace has pre-existing build failures in external dependencies (`mlx-swift-lm`, `IkigaJSON`). Never use `xcodebuild` to verify changes — it will always fail on those deps and waste tokens.

Instead, compile only the OsaurusCore package sources (no linking) to verify your changes:

```bash
cd /Users/tpae/dev/osaurus/Packages/OsaurusCore && swift build 2>&1 | grep -E "error:" | grep -v "IkigaJSON"
```

If the filtered output is empty, your code compiles cleanly.
